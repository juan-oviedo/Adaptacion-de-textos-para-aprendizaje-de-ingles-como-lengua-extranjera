Questions like 'How many girls finish school?' and 'What percentage of the world's population is poor?' Unfortunately, most of us get the answers wrong. Why does this happen? Factfulness explains why, showing that we have some instincts that make us see things in a wrong way.\n","\n","For example, people often divide the world into 'us' and 'them'. We also think that things are getting worse. And we read a lot of news that tries to scare us. But the authors say that the world is not as bad as we think. Yes, there are problems, but we should try to see things in a more positive way. This book helps us to do that by giving us practical advice on how to think more clearly about the world.\n","\n","Enlightenment Now – Steven Pinker\n","\n","Is the world getting worse every day? Can we really make progress? In Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker looks at the big picture of human progress and finds some good news. We are living longer, healthier, freer and happier lives.\n","\n","Pinker asks us to stop reading so much negative news. Instead, he shows us some data that tells a different story. In 75 graphs, we see that safety, peace, knowledge and health are improving all over the world. However, he also says that economic inequality is not a big problem. Some people might disagree with him.\n","\n","The main problem, Pinker argues, is that some people are attacking the values of reason and science. When politicians and commentators try to make people feel scared or angry, we are in danger of damaging important institutions like democracy and co-operation.\n","\n","The Rational Optimist – Matt Ridley\n","\n","For a long time, pessimists have been winning the public debate. They say that things are getting worse, but in fact, life is getting better. Income, food and lifespan are rising; disease, violence and child mortality are falling. These trends are happening all around the world. Africa is slowly coming out of poverty, just as Asia did before. The internet, mobile phones and trade are making millions of people's lives better.\n","\n","Matt Ridley's book not only shows us how things are getting better, but also why. He explains how human culture evolves in a positive way because of the exchange of ideas and specialisation. This book looks at the whole of human history and changes our idea that things are always getting worse.\n","\n","The Great Surge – Steven Radelet\n","\n","Most people think that developing countries are in a terrible situation, but this is not true.

Some people think that not all criminals are the same and that it would be better to give some of them community service instead. I agree that in some cases, prison is not the best solution and community service could be more helpful.\n","\n","One reason for having prisons is to keep society safe by taking criminals away from the outside world. So, the first thing to consider is whether someone who has broken the law is a danger to other people. If someone has committed a violent crime, it's probably a good idea to keep them away from society. However, if someone has committed a crime like burglary or possession of drugs, they are not a direct danger to anyone, and keeping them in prison is expensive for the taxpayer. It also doesn't seem like an effective punishment, as they often commit the same crime again when they get out.\n","\n","Personally, I think punishments should help people change their behaviour so they don't commit crimes again. Another reason not to put these people in prison is that they might mix with more violent and dangerous criminals, which could lead to them committing a worse crime when they get out. By keeping them in the community and helping others, they can learn new skills and develop more empathy and care for others. This would benefit society.\n","\n","Some people think that justice should be harsh to deter people from committing similar crimes, and that community service might not be as effective. However, there's not much evidence to suggest that long prison sentences actually deter criminals.\n","\n","In conclusion, putting non-violent criminals in prison is expensive and, in my opinion, not very effective. Community service for non-violent crimes can benefit both society and the offender. It would be helpful to have more data to see whether community service or prison is more likely to stop someone committing crimes again. I believe that decisions about how to deal with criminals should be based on evidence of what actually works.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  2 score:  7.12358762886598\n","A cheap light that uses gravity to generate power could be the best invention since the wind-up radio.

Factfulness by Hans Rosling, Ola Rosling and Anna Rosling Rönnlund\n","\n","In their book Factfulness, Professor Hans Rosling and his co-authors pose a series of simple yet thought-provoking questions about the world, such as 'How many girls finish school?' and 'What percentage of the world's population is poor?' The authors' research reveals that most people's answers to these questions are often incorrect. They argue that our perception of the world is distorted by certain instincts, including a tendency to divide the world into 'us' and 'them', a bias towards negative news and a reliance on emotional rather than factual information.\n","\n","However, the authors contend that the world is not as bleak as we often believe. While there are certainly challenges to be addressed, they advocate for a more fact-based approach to understanding global issues. By adopting a mindset of factfulness, individuals can make more informed decisions and develop a more nuanced understanding of the world.\n","\n","2. Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker\n","\n","In Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker presents a compelling case for human progress, arguing that we are living longer, healthier, freer and happier lives. He challenges readers to look beyond negative headlines and instead focus on the evidence, which he presents in the form of 75 carefully selected graphs. Pinker's data reveals that safety, peace, knowledge and health are all improving globally.\n","\n","However, Pinker's argument is not without its limitations. He downplays the significance of economic inequality, a claim that may be disputed by those living in poverty. Nevertheless, he identifies a more pressing concern: the erosion of Enlightenment values such as reason and science. When these values are undermined, Pinker warns, we risk damaging essential institutions like democracy and international cooperation.\n","\n","3. The Rational Optimist by Matt Ridley\n","\n","For over two centuries, pessimists have dominated the public debate, claiming that things are getting worse. However, Matt Ridley's The Rational Optimist presents a contrarian view, arguing that life is actually improving. Income, food availability and lifespan are all on the rise, while disease, violence and child mortality are in decline. Ridley attributes this progress to the exchange of ideas and specialisation, which have driven human culture forward in a positive direction.\n","\n","Ridley's book is a bold challenge to the conventional wisdom, spanning the entirety of human history from the Stone Age to the present day. By examining the evidence, he shows that the glass is indeed half-full, and that we should be optimistic about the future.\n","\n","4. The Great Surge by Steven Radelet\n","\n","The Great Surge by Steven Radelet presents a surprising and uplifting portrait of developing countries. Contrary to popular perceptions, these countries are experiencing a significant transformation, with over 700 million people increasing their income and escaping poverty. Additionally, millions more girls are in school, and millions of people have access to clean water.\n","\n","Radelet attributes this progress to a combination of factors, including the end of the Cold War, the development of new technologies and brave new leadership. His book offers a hopeful vision of a world in which hundreds of millions of people are improving their lives.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  3 score:  9.296935483870971\n","From: Paco\n","To: Maria\n","Subject: Thanks\n","\n","Dear Maria,\n","\n","I hope you're doing well.

One day, her aunt took her to see the 1997 film Titanic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Susan was captivated by the sight of the vast ocean, which was a new and unfamiliar experience for her. As she watched the movie, she turned to her aunt and said, \"I'm going to sail on a ship like that one day, auntie.\"\n","\n","True to her words, Susan left Nebraska and moved to Los Angeles, California, where she could live near the ocean. She was thrilled to discover that the Queen Mary, a ship of similar size to the Titanic, was permanently docked in Long Beach. The Queen Mary is now a museum and popular tourist attraction, and Susan was eager to book a tour of the ship. \"This is fantastic,\" she thought to herself as she boarded the vessel.\n","\n","Upon arrival, Susan was not disappointed. The ship was just as she had imagined it – luxurious and well-preserved. The tour she took highlighted the ship's rich history and its significance over the years. Susan enjoyed dining at one of the three restaurants on board and spending the night in the ship's hotel. The Queen Mary was built in the 1930s in Great Britain and had a long and illustrious career, sailing across the Atlantic Ocean and hosting many famous guests, including Winston Churchill, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and numerous Hollywood celebrities.

Some people argue that prison is not always the best solution, especially for those who are not a direct threat to society. In my opinion, there are cases where prison may not be the most effective way to deal with a crime, and community service could be a more beneficial option.\n","\n","One of the main arguments in favour of prison is that it keeps society safe by removing dangerous individuals from the outside world. However, this justification is not always valid. For instance, non-violent crimes such as burglary or drug possession do not pose a direct threat to others. Keeping these individuals in prison is not only expensive but also ineffective, as they often reoffend once released.\n","\n","In addition, I believe that punishments should aim to reform individuals, helping them to become law-abiding citizens. By giving community service, offenders can learn new skills, develop empathy and care for others, and contribute to society in a positive way. This approach not only benefits the offender but also the community.\n","\n","On the other hand, critics of this rehabilitative approach argue that harsh punishments are necessary to deter people from committing similar crimes. However, there is limited evidence to suggest that long prison sentences are an effective deterrent. In fact, research suggests that community service can be just as effective, if not more so, in preventing reoffending.\n","\n","In conclusion, imprisoning non-violent offenders is not only expensive but also ineffective. Community service, on the other hand, can be a more beneficial option for both society and the offender. To make informed decisions about how best to deal with criminals, we need more data on what works and what does not. I firmly believe that our approach to crime should be evidence-based, rather than relying on assumptions or personal opinions.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  3 score:  11.816432885906043\n","Here is the adapted text for B2 level:\n","\n","A revolutionary new light that harnesses the power of gravity could soon become a game-changer in Africa and India, where millions of people still rely on hazardous kerosene-fuelled lamps.

Ironically, Owens received more favourable treatment during his time at the 1936 Olympics in Germany.\n","\n","During the games, Hitler became increasingly agitated as Owens accumulated an impressive haul of gold medals. Owens' successes served as a potent rebuke to Hitler's racist ideologies and rhetoric, which he had vociferously espoused. Hitler was particularly displeased with Owens' achievements, and Owens ultimately emerged victorious, claiming four gold medals at the games. In a notable snub, Hitler declined to shake Owens' hand. One of the most enduring images from the games is that of Owens forming a lasting friendship with German athlete Luz Long, a bond that was especially significant given the risks that Long faced as a consequence of befriending someone who was deemed an outcast by Hitler's regime.\n","\n","Many German fans extended their congratulations to Owens, despite Hitler's disapproval.

Her childhood memories are replete with images of corn fields and seemingly endless expanses of land that stretched out as far as the eye could see. One pivotal moment in her early life occurred when her aunt took her to watch the 1997 film Titanic, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The sheer magnitude of the ocean depicted in the movie left an indelible mark on Susan, and she distinctly remembers turning to her aunt with the fervent declaration, \"I'm going to sail on a ship like that one day, auntie.\"\n","\n","True to her words, Susan eventually left Nebraska and relocated to Los Angeles, California, driven by an insatiable desire to reside near the ocean. Her arrival in Long Beach proved to be a serendipitous encounter, as she discovered that the Queen Mary was permanently moored in the city. This grand ship, a museum and tourist attraction in its own right, boasts the same dimensions as the Titanic and has been meticulously restored to its original state. Susan's decision to book a tour of the ship was a resounding success, as she was able to immerse herself in the vessel's rich history and opulent surroundings.\n","\n","Upon embarking on the Queen Mary, Susan was struck by the sheer grandeur of the ship. The tour she undertook provided a comprehensive insight into the vessel's storied past, highlighting its significance as a luxurious ocean liner that had played host to an array of distinguished guests, including Winston Churchill, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and numerous Hollywood celebrities. During World War II, the ship was repurposed as a troop transport, with the capacity to carry up to 18,000 Allied soldiers per journey. Following the war, the Queen Mary was restored to its former glory and resumed its transatlantic voyages. In 1967, the city of Long Beach acquired the aging ocean liner, transforming it into a beloved attraction that has captivated visitors ever since. As Susan reflected on her visit, she aptly described the experience as \"living history.\"\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  4 score:  16.662745098039213\n","The notion that imprisonment is the most effective means of addressing the complexities of crime has been subject to intense scrutiny. Proponents of this stance argue that incarceration serves as a deterrent, thereby safeguarding society by removing offenders from the general populace. Conversely, some advocate for a more nuanced approach, contending that certain offenders would be better served by community service, rather than imprisonment. I concur that, in certain instances, imprisonment may not be the most efficacious solution, and that community service could potentially yield more beneficial outcomes.\n","\n","One of the primary justifications for imprisonment is the perceived need to safeguard society by isolating offenders from the broader community. However, this rationale is predicated on the assumption that all offenders pose a tangible threat to public safety. In reality, this is not always the case. Non-violent crimes, such as burglary or drug possession, do not inherently pose a danger to others, thereby rendering imprisonment a costly and ineffective means of punishment.\n","\n","Furthermore, I firmly believe that the ultimate goal of punishment should be to reform offenders, thereby preventing recidivism. By subjecting individuals to community service, they are not only acquiring new skills, but also developing empathy and a greater sense of responsibility towards others. Conversely, imprisonment can often have the opposite effect, as offenders may be exposed to more hardened and violent individuals, thereby increasing the likelihood of further criminal activity upon release.\n","\n","Critics of the rehabilitative approach to crime argue that a harsher stance is necessary to deter individuals from committing similar offences. However, empirical evidence suggests that lengthy prison sentences have a negligible impact on recidivism rates. In light of this, I firmly believe that decisions regarding the most effective means of addressing crime should be based on verifiable data, rather than conjecture or ideology.\n","\n","In conclusion, imprisoning non-violent offenders is not only a costly endeavour, but also an ineffective means of rehabilitation and deterrence. Community service, on the other hand, offers a more holistic approach to addressing crime, one that benefits both society and the offender. Ultimately, it is essential to base decisions on empirical evidence, rather than relying on unsubstantiated assumptions or ideologies.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  4 score:  12.447356365718647\n","Here is the text adapted for a C1 class:\n","\n","The invention of a cheap, gravity-powered light could be a groundbreaking innovation, reminiscent of Trevor Baylis's wind-up radio in the pre-internet era of the 1990s. This low-cost light, which harnesses energy from gravity, has the potential to replace hazardous kerosene-fuelled lamps in Africa and India. However, when British designer Patrick Hunt sought to commercialise his invention, he encountered significant challenges. \"We attempted to secure funding from banks or venture capitalists, but the process was slow, complex, and unproven, and nobody was willing to take a risk,\" he explained.\n","\n","Undeterred, Hunt turned to crowdfunding on the US-based platform Indiegogo, which had recently launched in the UK. Within five days, he had exceeded his target, raising £36,200. The campaign's popularity was such that, within 40 days, he had secured a staggering £400,000 in donations. The LED light is powered by a dynamo driven by the descent of a 10kg bag of rocks. The weight is attached to the light, lifted to a height of approximately 2m, and while it is allowed to slowly fall to the ground, it generates enough power for half an hour of light.\n","\n","Hunt is now preparing for mass production in China and plans to test the market by delivering 1,000 units to Africa before the full-scale production of what he hopes will be millions of units.

Another emerging platform is InvestingZone, which matches high-net-worth individuals with start-up entrepreneurs.\n","\n","Indiegogo does not offer shares but allows users to offer \"perks\" for different levels of donation. Those who contributed to Hunt's innovative light not only felt good about helping the less fortunate but also received their own light.

The site was initially focused on the film industry and launched at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008. Five years on, it is raising approximately $2m per week for new businesses in start-up and growth stages. In December 2012, it launched a euro and sterling service to gain a foothold in Europe and has since seen international activity increase by 41%.\n","\n","There is no shortage of competitors in the crowdfunding market, including Kickstarter, Seedrs, and Funding Circle. However, unlike its rivals, Indiegogo is the only platform where anyone can launch a campaign, regardless of how unconventional the project may be. The site charges a 4% fee for successful campaigns, while those that fail to raise their target amount have the option of either refunding all money to contributors or keeping the raised funds at a 9% fee.\n","\n","A British woman, Lauren Pears, successfully raised £100,000 to open a \"cat café\" in London through Indiegogo. Known as Lady Dinah's Cat Emporium, it is set to become a unique destination where people can relax in a comfortable environment surrounded by cats. Ringelmann believes that crowdfunding allows entrepreneurs to test their market, pricing, and features, and to gather vital feedback.\n","\n","With her Wall Street background and extensive experience in helping businesses raise finance, Ringelmann has developed valuable advice for budding entrepreneurs. \"Ideas are a dime a dozen,\" she says. \"It's all about execution, and if you're afraid that your idea will be stolen by someone who can execute it better and faster than you, then you're not the right person to execute that idea.

Questions such as \"What percentage of the global population has access to education?\" and \"How many people worldwide live in poverty?\" The authors reveal that the majority of us are woefully misinformed about these issues, and that our perceptions are often distorted by ingrained cognitive biases.\n","\n","For instance, we tend to dichotomise the world into \"us\" and \"them\", and we frequently assume that things are getting progressively worse. Furthermore, we are bombarded with sensationalised media that prey on our fears in order to sell us stories. However, as Rosling and his co-authors argue, the world is not as bleak as we think. While there are certainly pressing concerns, the facts suggest that we should adopt a more nuanced and fact-based approach to understanding global issues.\n","\n","Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress\n","\n","In his book Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker presents a compelling case for the idea that progress is not only possible, but also a reality. By examining a vast array of data and statistics, Pinker demonstrates that we are living longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives. He challenges us to re-evaluate our perceptions of the world, urging us to move beyond the negativity of the media and to focus on the many positive trends that are unfolding.\n","\n","Pinker's argument is not without controversy, however. He dismisses the notion that economic inequality is a significant problem, suggesting that it is not a major determinant of human well-being. While this perspective may be disputed by many, Pinker's central thesis – that the Enlightenment values of reason and science are under attack – is a timely and important warning. As he notes, the erosion of these values poses a significant threat to our democracy and our capacity for global cooperation.\n","\n","The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves\n","\n","Matt Ridley's The Rational Optimist offers a bold and contrarian view of the world. For over two centuries, pessimists have dominated the public debate, claiming that things are getting worse. However, as Ridley argues, this narrative is fundamentally flawed. By examining the long-term trends in income, food availability, and lifespan, he demonstrates that life is, in fact, getting better.\n","\n","Ridley's book is not only a celebration of progress, but also an exploration of the underlying drivers of human culture. He shows how the exchange of ideas and specialisation have led to the evolution of human society in a positive direction. By examining the entirety of human history, from the Stone Age to the present day, Ridley challenges the conventional wisdom that the world is headed inexorably towards decline.\n","\n","The Great Surge: The Ascent of the Developing World\n","\n","In The Great Surge, Steven Radelet presents a compelling case for the idea that developing countries are undergoing a profound transformation. Contrary to the prevailing narrative that these countries are mired in poverty and despair, Radelet argues that a great surge of progress is underway. Over the past 20 years, more than 700 million people have escaped poverty, and millions more have gained access to education, healthcare, and clean water.\n","\n","Radelet's book is not only a celebration of this progress, but also a call to action.

This study endeavoured to determine the willingness to pay (WTP) for the restoration of the park's attributes utilising discrete choice experiment. The focus was on the attributes of (1) wildlife population and species diversity, (2) wildlife movement in dispersion and migration areas, (3) vegetation density and diversity, (4) wildlife and human security, and (5) environmental safety and quality. The data employed was garnered from a survey of 93 students at the Nairobi campus of Kisii University. A price attribute in the form of an increase in gate fee was incorporated to elicit WTP estimates. Multinomial logit regression estimates revealed that respondents were willing to pay for the restoration of all the attributes except attribute 4.

Consequently, some argue that not all criminals are identical and that community service would be a more fitting retribution in certain instances. I concur that, in some cases, incarceration may not be the most efficacious solution, and community service would likely yield more benefits.\n","\n","One of the primary justifications for prisons is to safeguard society by isolating perpetrators from the outside world. However, this rationale necessitates a preliminary consideration: does an individual who has transgressed the law pose a threat to the well-being of others? In cases of violent crime, there is a compelling argument to keep the perpetrator at a distance from society. Conversely, crimes such as burglary or possession of narcotics do not inherently involve violence against others, thereby rendering the perpetrator a non-immediate threat to the community. The financial burden of imprisoning these individuals on taxpayers is substantial, and it appears that this approach is not an effective form of punishment, as they often reoffend upon release.\n","\n","Personally, I also believe that punishments should serve a rehabilitative function, thereby preventing recidivism. A further reason not to imprison these individuals is that they may interact with more violent and dangerous offenders, potentially committing a more heinous crime upon release. By keeping them within the community, where they can engage in helpful activities, they not only acquire new skills but also develop a greater capacity for empathy and compassion towards others. This, in turn, can only serve to benefit society as a whole.\n","\n","Detractors of this rehabilitative approach to crime argue that justice should be stringent in order to deter similar crimes and that community service may be less likely to achieve this effect. However, empirical evidence suggests that lengthy prison sentences have little to no deterrent effect on offenders.\n","\n","In conclusion, imprisoning individuals who pose no threat to society is both expensive and, in my opinion, ineffectual, serving neither as a deterrent nor as a form of rehabilitation. Community service for non-violent crimes, on the other hand, benefits both society and the offender. That being said, it would be advantageous to have more data to determine whether community service or imprisonment is more likely to prevent recidivism.

This will, in turn, necessitate significant investments in research and development, as well as the implementation of stringent quality control measures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the testing process.\n","\n","The European Commission's proposal has been welcomed by environmental campaigners, who have long argued that the current testing regime has been inadequate in addressing the issue of air pollution. \"The development of a new, real-world driving emission test is an important step forward in tackling urban air pollution,\" said Greg Archer, the clean vehicles manager for Transport and Environment.\n","\n","However, the car industry has expressed concerns about the feasibility of implementing the new regulations, arguing that a five-year lead-time is necessary to ensure a smooth transition. Industry groups have also disputed allegations that they have attempted to delay reforms to car test cycles, with the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) stating that they \"fully accept\" the new regulations.\n","\n","In a surprising move, the ACEA sent a draft regulation to Timmermans, which would have covered fewer pollutants and further delayed the regulation's phased introduction until 2020. However, this proposal was ultimately rejected, and the regulation will now proceed to the commissioners for a rubber stamp and member states for final amendments before its expected introduction in September 2017.\n","\n","The introduction of real-world emissions testing in the EU will be closely watched by other countries, which are also grappling with the issue of air pollution. A similar battle is already looming over the testing of CO2 emissions for cars, and the EU's new emissions tests will serve as a benchmark for the global automotive industry.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  5 score:  15.812517758484613\n","The disparity in bonus payments between male and female bosses in the UK is a stark illustration of the inequitable nature of pay in British business. According to the Chartered Management Institute (CMI), men in management roles received average bonuses of £6,442 in 2012, compared to £3,029 for their female counterparts. This disparity translates into a substantial difference in salary top-ups over the course of a working lifetime, with men enjoying bonuses of £141,500 more than women.\n","\n","The CMI's findings are particularly striking when considering the most senior roles, where female directors received bonuses of £36,270, whereas male directors were awarded £63,700. These discrepancies are not merely a reflection of individual circumstances but rather a symptom of a broader cultural issue within British business. The emphasis on masculine cultures, long working hours, and a lack of transparency around performance and rewards all contribute to this disparity.\n","\n","The issue of unequal pay is not new, and the government has been working to address it. The Minister for Women and Equalities, Maria Miller, has acknowledged that while progress has been made, there is still much to be done to achieve full equality in the workplace. The government has implemented various initiatives, including the Think, Act, Report scheme, which encourages companies to improve their recruitment, promotion, and pay practices for women.\n","\n","However, the CMI's data also suggests that the pay gap is narrowing, with the difference between the average salaries earned by male and female bosses decreasing from £10,060 in 2012 to £8,502 in the most recent figures. Nevertheless, this trend is not uniform across all levels of management, and the disparities in bonus payments remain a pressing concern.\n","\n","The latest figures have prompted calls for action from campaigners on workplace equality, who argue that the issue of unequal pay requires a fundamental shift in the way businesses approach management. As Ann Francke, the CMI's chief executive, noted, \"It's time to move this issue into the mainstream management agenda.\" By changing our approach to management and prioritizing transparency, flexibility, and outcomes, we can not only address the issue of unequal pay but also raise the performance of organizations and the well-being of individuals at work.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  5 score:  15.837606741573037\n","Here's the adapted text for C2 level:\n","\n","The LAX shooting: a complex and multifaceted investigation\n","\n","Following a weekend of intense scrutiny, authorities are endeavouring to piece together the intricate details surrounding the fatal shooting at Los Angeles International Airport on Friday. The investigation, which has thus far yielded a plethora of information, has revealed a complex web of events that may have ultimately led to the tragic outcome.\n","\n","At the centre of the investigation is Paul Ciancia, a 23-year-old man from Los Angeles, who has been charged with murder and commission of violence in an international airport. Ciancia, who was shot by officers on Friday and remains in critical condition at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Centre, has thus far been unable to communicate with investigators.\n","\n","The investigation has revealed that Ciancia's actions may have been motivated by a desire to instil fear in Transportation Security Administration employees, whom he perceived as having \"traitorous minds\". A note found on Ciancia's person, which was subsequently analysed by FBI Special Agent in Charge David Bowdich, provides insight into the suspect's mindset and highlights the complexity of the case.\n","\n","Furthermore, the investigation has uncovered a timeline of events that may have contributed to the shooting. According to a source, Ciancia had been asking for a ride to the airport for several days prior to the shooting, claiming that he needed to visit his sick father in New Jersey. However, it is unclear whether Ciancia's family was aware of his true intentions.\n","\n","In the hours leading up to the shooting, Ciancia's family had been in contact with him, with one family member expressing concern about his mental state. A text message sent by Ciancia to his family members in New Jersey suggested that he was unhappy and may have been contemplating harm to himself. Although Ciancia's family had been in contact with the Los Angeles Police Department, it is unclear whether they were able to provide sufficient information to prevent the shooting.\n","\n","The investigation has also highlighted the rapid response of airport police officers, who shot Ciancia multiple times in the chest, striking him in the face and neck. The officers, who were 60 seconds behind Ciancia, were praised for their bravery and quick thinking in the face of a rapidly unfolding situation.\n","\n","The shooting has raised questions about airport security and the need for better coordination between local law enforcement and TSA agencies. TSA Administrator John Pistole has announced a review of security protocol with partner agencies, while Rep. Michael McCaul has suggested that better coordination with local law enforcement could improve security at checkpoints.\n","\n","The incident has had a significant impact on air travel, with over 167,000 passengers affected by cancellations, delays, or diversions to other airports. The airport has since returned to normal operations, but the incident has highlighted the need for enhanced security measures at airports across the country.\n","\n","In a statement, Ciancia's family expressed their shock and grief at the tragic events of last Friday, while also conveying their hopes for a speedy recovery for those injured in the shooting. The family's statement highlights the complexity of the case and the need for a nuanced understanding of the events that led to the shooting.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  5 score:  15.084621359223302\n","A poignant and poignant narrative of a lonely elderly man residing in a lunar crater has been woven into the fabric of John Lewis's 2015 Christmas campaign, as the department store endeavours to harness its considerable influence to raise substantial sums for Age UK. This charitable initiative is a hallmark of the retailer's seasonal advertising, which has become a benchmark for the Christmas shopping season.\n","\n","The campaign, which has garnered immense hype, will not only feature a multi-million-pound television advertisement but also a smartphone game and a range of merchandise, including glow-in-the-dark pyjamas, as well as specially designed in-store displays that evoke the lunar surface. The retailer has invested £7 million in this endeavour, a significant portion of which will be devoted to raising awareness and funds for Age UK.\n","\n","At the heart of the campaign is a narrative that tugs at the heartstrings, centred around a young girl named Lily, who discovers an elderly man living in a lunar shack through her telescope. Undeterred by the vast distance between them, Lily endeavours to establish a connection with the old man, eventually succeeding in conveying her kindness and compassion.\n","\n","The campaign's strapline, \"Show someone they're loved this Christmas,\" resonates with Age UK's own initiative, \"No one should have no one at Christmas.\" Profits from three products – a mug, gift tag, and card – will be donated to the charity. Rachel Swift, John Lewis's head of marketing, underscored the significance of the campaign, noting that it encourages viewers to consider those who may be alone during the holiday season.\n","\n","The campaign features a poignant rendition of the Oasis track \"Half the World Away,\" reinterpreted by the Norwegian artist Aurora. The television advertisement, which cost £1 million to produce, was filmed at the Warner Bros Studios, where the Harry Potter films were shot, and features a specially constructed lunar set created by the team behind the latest Star Wars film, The Force Awakens.\n","\n","As in previous years, John Lewis has drummed up interest in its latest advertisement with a teaser campaign on television and social media, using the hashtag #OnTheMoon. The full moon on Christmas Day 2015 is a coincidence, according to Swift.\n","\n","John Lewis's strategy has remained consistent over the past five years, with a focus on thoughtful gifting and going the extra mile for loved ones during the holiday season.

Furthermore, he disclosed that the heat had induced hallucinations: \"I was dizzy from the middle of the first set and then I saw Snoopy and I thought, 'Wow, Snoopy – that’s weird.'\" \n","\n","\"I think it's inhumane,\" he asserted. \"I don't think it's fair to anyone – to the players, to the fans, to the sport – when you see players pulling out of matches, passing out. I've played five-set matches all my life and being out there for a set and a half and passing out with heat stroke, it's not normal.\" \n","\n","Dancevic emphasized that having numerous players experiencing difficulties and complaining to the tournament about the excessive heat, only to be ignored, was unconscionable. \"Until somebody dies, they just keep going on with it and putting matches on in this heat. I, personally, don't think it's fair and I know a lot of players don't think it's fair.\" \n","\n","Other players concurred with Dancevic's sentiments. The British number one, Andy Murray, stated: \"It's definitely something that you have to look at a little bit. As much as it's easy to say the conditions are safe, it only takes one bad thing to happen. And it looks terrible for the whole sport when people are collapsing, ball kids are collapsing, people in the stands are collapsing. That's not great.\" \n","\n","Caroline Wozniacki observed: \"I put the water bottle down on the court and it started melting a little bit underneath the plastic. So, you know it was warm.\" \n","\n","John Isner, who retired from his first-round match with a right ankle injury, described the conditions as \"like an oven when I open the oven and the potatoes are done.\" That's what it's like.\" \n","\n","The defending champion Victoria Azarenka took a similar stance. \"It felt pretty hot, like you're dancing in a frying pan or something like that,\" she said. \n","\n","The tournament's \"extreme heat\" contingency plan was activated for women's matches on Tuesday, allowing an extra ten-minute break between the second and third sets. However, under a change to the rules for 2014, the decision on whether to stop matches at the tournament now rests with the tournament director, Wayne McKewen. Rather than relying solely on the raw Celsius readings to assess the heat, organizers prefer to use the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature composite, which also takes into account humidity and wind to gauge the perceived conditions. \n","\n","McKewen stated: \"We have to reach a minimum threshold and have a forecast that it will be sustained for a reasonable time. That didn't happen. While conditions were hot and uncomfortable, the relatively low level of humidity ensured play would continue.\" \n","\n","Dancevic, who said he had felt dizzy from the middle of the second set, resumed after medical attention but, unsurprisingly, ultimately lost the match 7–6, 6–3, 6–4. \"I was really close to stopping completely,\" he said. \"I wasn't really running too much towards the end. I wasn't tired; I just felt my body temperature was too high.\" \n","\n","A ball boy had earlier required medical attention after collapsing during Milos Raonic's 7–6, 6–1, 4–6, 6–2 victory over Daniel Gimeno-Traver on the equally exposed court eight and the tournament shortened rotations for the ball boys to 45-minute shifts. China's Peng Shuai also reported that the heat had caused her to cramp up and vomit, and she had to be helped from the court after her 7–5, 4–6, 6–3 defeat to Japan's Kurumi Nara. \n","\n","Organizers downplayed the health risks, stating that the majority of matches were completed without calls for medical attention. \"Of course, there were a few players who experienced heat-related illness or discomfort, but none required significant medical intervention after they had completed their match,\" Tim Wood, the tournament's chief medical officer, said in a statement. \n","\n","Most competitors, however, followed Roger Federer's line that, although conditions were challenging, they were the same for both players. \"It's just a mental thing,\" the Swiss said. \"If you've trained hard enough your entire life, or the last few weeks, and you believe you can do it and come through it, there's no reason. If you can't deal with it, you throw in the towel.\" \n","\n","Dancevic disagreed. \"I don't think it's much to do with the shape the players are in. Some players are used to the heat – their bodies can genetically handle the heat and others' can't,\" he said. \"It's hazardous to be out there; it's dangerous. It's an hour and a half since my match and I still can't pee.\"\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  5 score:  12.573118612832968\n","It has become increasingly challenging for even a seasoned defense attorney to keep abreast of the mounting allegations against Bill Cosby. Recently, Cosby's embattled attorneys submitted a motion to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the actor-comedian of sexually assaulting plaintiff Judith Huth in 1974 at the Playboy Mansion, where she was merely 15 years old at the time.\n","\n","Huth claims that she and a 16-year-old friend met Cosby on a film set in the Los Angeles area, only to have him allegedly ply them with drinks at a tennis club a week later. Subsequently, the lawsuit asserts that Cosby took Huth to the Playboy Mansion, where he allegedly compelled her to engage in a sex act. Cosby and his attorneys are not retreating quietly into the night, having filed a demurrer that challenges the legal sufficiency of the claims or the complaint itself.\n","\n","In essence, the demurrer posits that the complaint is so fundamentally flawed that it should be dismissed outright. Furthermore, Cosby's attorneys have gone on the offensive, requesting that the court impose sanctions against the attorneys who filed the lawsuit. In the court of public opinion, many have already reached a verdict, concluding that there is substance to these mounting accusations. Conversely, Camille Cosby's retort that media coverage of her husband is comparable to the Rolling Stone UVA alleged gang rape article may sway public sentiment.\n","\n","However, in the real court, the rules are starkly different. Huth's attorneys should have adhered to these rules, which they failed to do. If they were aware that it was impossible to comply with the rules, then they should have known that the complaint was fatally defective when they filed it. Irrespective of any breakdown in communication between lawyer and client, this complaint should likely be dismissed.\n","\n","Cosby breaks his silence as Huth filed her complaint well after the time permitted by the statute of limitations. Statutes of limitations are laws that set the maximum period during which one can wait before filing a lawsuit, and they vary depending on the state and type of case. While limitations periods are arbitrary, the underlying public policy is not: defendants deserve protection of the law as well. It makes sense that you should not have to be hauled into court tomorrow for a minor traffic accident you got into with your 1977 AMC Gremlin – in 1977.\n","\n","However, there is a significant difference between a minor traffic accident and sexual assault cases. Limitations periods are more contentious in sexual assault cases because complainants – often children – may repress memories or fear coming forward. Indeed, the abject terror or trauma caused by an assailant may be why the victim allows the limitations period to expire.\n","\n","Accordingly, some jurisdictions have special rules extending the time to file in cases of childhood sexual abuse. Under California law, the only way that an alleged victim of childhood sexual abuse can bring an otherwise time-barred claim is to allege that the psychological injury was repressed and was only discovered within the last three years.\n","\n","Since this constitutes a potentially limitless limitations period, the rule has two major safeguards built into it to prevent meritless claims and protect the rights of would-be defendants. Firstly, when asserting claims based on alleged childhood sexual abuse, a plaintiff over the age of 26 must file Certificates of Merit, documents executed by a licensed mental health practitioner attesting that the allegations have merit.\n","\n","Cosby's attorneys correctly point out that Huth failed to file the requisite certificates, which exposes the complaint itself to attack. The public policy behind this rule is sound: taking a plaintiff's word that they repressed a memory that caused them to miss the statute of limitations invites uncertainty and fraud.\n","\n","Huth was 15 years old in 1974 when the alleged abuse took place, and at least 55 years old when she filed this lawsuit. However, Cosby's lawyers point out that she attempted to sell this story to the tabloids more than nine years ago. Even if Huth is allowed to file these certificates, what medical professional will certify her lost memory until three years ago of an event – that she tried to profit from by selling word of it some years before that?\n","\n","Secondly, the rule provides some protection to would-be defendants and their privacy. After all, requiring some initial scientific proof of a repressed memory and injury is a good idea, but a medical provider cannot really provide any assurances about the identity of an assailant – other than relying upon the patient's words. That's why a plaintiff is prohibited under the rules from identifying the defendant by name until the court gives permission.\n","\n","Huth could have complied with this rule by naming Cosby as John Doe, or some anonymous designation. She did not. Her attorneys filed her complaint naming Cosby. You might think this is just a clerical gaffe that could be remedied, as many are, by filing an amended complaint – as she eventually did. Cosby's attorneys point out that this is no mere mistake that can be fixed. Plaintiff already identified Cosby in the complaint prior to obtaining court permission.\n","\n","Even if Huth amended her complaint, Cosby's name is out there. As Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, and many at Sony have learned, you cannot un-ring the privacy bell – once your name – or image – is out there, it's out there. Childhood sexual abuse is a detestable crime, and the injuries last a lifetime. Recognizing this, modern jurisdictions have amended the normally inflexible statutes of limitations to allow victims their day in court, while seeking to protect would-be defendants from meritless claims.\n","\n","Huth's case illustrates that these rules are not merely procedural. Violating these protective rules threatens the public perception of other legitimate victims who want their day in court. The court of public opinion will likely ignore these violations as technicalities, and continue to judge, and condemn Cosby. That's how that court operates – unfettered by the nuisances of the rules of procedure or evidence. But, under the rules of the Superior Court of California, this complaint should be dismissed.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  6 score:  2.4833333333333343\n","The teacher is calling the roll.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  6 score:  2.6190181335692166\n","A man hurt himself badly in a car accident in Apeldoorn.

They believe that certain criminals could be given community service instead. I agree that in some cases, prison is not the best solution and community service could be more helpful.\n","\n","One reason for having prisons is to keep society safe by taking criminals away from the outside world. However, if someone has committed a crime that doesn't involve violence, they are not a direct danger to others. For example, burglary or possessing drugs doesn't involve violence. Keeping these people in prison is expensive for taxpayers and doesn't seem to be an effective punishment because they often commit the same crime again when they get out.\n","\n","I also think that punishments should help people change their behaviour so they don't commit crimes again. Another reason not to put these people in prison is that they might mix with more violent and dangerous criminals and commit a worse crime when they're released. If they do community service, they can learn new skills and develop more empathy and care for others. This can only benefit society.\n","\n","Some people think that justice should be strict to stop people committing similar crimes. They believe that community service might not have the same effect. However, there is little evidence to suggest that long prison sentences stop people committing crimes.\n","\n","In conclusion, putting people who are not a danger to society in prison is expensive and, in my opinion, not very effective. Community service for non-violent crimes can benefit both society and the person who committed the crime. We need more data to find out if community service or prison is more likely to stop people committing crimes again. I think that decisions about how to deal with criminals should be based on what actually works.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  8 score:  8.528731551655365\n","A Cheap and Safe Light for Africa and India\n","\n","A British designer, Patrick Hunt, has invented a cheap and safe light that can be powered by gravity.

However, the park has faced significant damage in recent years due to the construction of a standard gauge railway line and a highway known as the Southern bypass. These developments raise concerns about the potential environmental impact, which could be substantial. This study aimed to determine the willingness of people to pay for the restoration of the park's attributes using a method called discrete choice experiment. The focus was on five key attributes: \n","\n","1. The number and variety of wildlife species\n","2. The freedom of wildlife to move and migrate\n","3. The density and diversity of vegetation\n","4. The safety of both wildlife and people\n","5. The overall quality of the environment\n","\n","The data used in this study was collected from 93 students at Kisii University's Nairobi campus. To find out how much people were willing to pay, the researchers included an attribute related to the price of entering the park, such as an increase in the gate fee. The results showed that people were willing to pay for the restoration of all the attributes, except for the safety of wildlife and people. The two attributes that elicited the highest willingness to pay were the number and variety of wildlife species, and the freedom of wildlife to move and migrate. The study also found that middle-aged people with stable jobs were more likely to pay for the restoration of the park's attributes compared to students and young people.

She was thrilled to discover that the Queen Mary, a historic ship similar in size to the Titanic, was permanently docked in Long Beach. Susan booked a tour of the ship without hesitation, eager to experience it for herself. \"This is wonderful,\" she thought to herself as she boarded the vessel.\n","\n","Upon arrival, Susan was not disappointed. The ship exceeded her expectations, with its luxurious interior and rich history. The tour highlighted the Queen Mary's significance over the years, and Susan had the opportunity to dine at one of the three restaurants and spend the night in the ship's hotel. Built in the 1930s in Great Britain, the Queen Mary had a storied past, having hosted prominent figures such as Winston Churchill, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, and numerous Hollywood celebrities.

In cases where prison is not the most effective solution, community service may have more benefits.\n","\n","One of the main reasons for keeping criminals in prison is to protect society by removing them from the outside world. However, this approach only makes sense if the individual poses a direct threat to others. In cases of violent crime, it is understandable to keep the perpetrator isolated from society. Nevertheless, for non-violent crimes such as burglary or drug possession, the individual does not pose a direct danger to others and imprisonment may not be the most effective solution.\n","\n","From a financial perspective, keeping these types of criminals in prison is expensive for taxpayers, and research suggests that it is not an effective form of punishment as they often reoffend when released. Furthermore, by mixing with more violent and dangerous criminals, they may be at risk of committing a more serious crime when they are released.\n","\n","In my opinion, punishments should also aim to reform individuals so that they do not reoffend. By keeping them in the community and helping others through community service, they can develop new skills, gain empathy and a sense of responsibility towards others. This approach can only benefit society.\n","\n","Some critics argue that harsh punishments are necessary to deter people from committing similar crimes. However, there is little evidence to suggest that long prison sentences have a deterrent effect. On the other hand, community service may be more effective in preventing reoffending.\n","\n","In conclusion, imprisoning non-violent offenders is not only expensive but also ineffective as a deterrent and a form of rehabilitation. Community service, on the other hand, can benefit both society and the offender. While more research is needed to determine the most effective approach, I firmly believe that decisions on how to deal with criminals should be based on evidence of what actually works.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  9 score:  10.857378426171532\n","Here is the text adapted for B2 class:\n","\n","A British designer, Patrick Hunt, has invented a cheap and innovative light that draws free power from gravity.

However, the majority of us tend to respond to these questions with inaccurate answers, often due to our inherent biases and flawed perceptions. Factfulness delves into the psychological and cognitive factors that underlie these distortions, highlighting the need for a more nuanced understanding of the world.\n","\n","One of the primary obstacles to a more accurate perception of reality is the tendency to dichotomise the world into 'us' and 'them', as well as the propensity to believe that things are worsening. Furthermore, the media often exploits our fears by using a sales model that relies on sensationalism and alarmism. However, the authors argue that the world is not as bleak as we often perceive it to be. By adopting a fact-based approach, we can develop a more balanced and informed perspective on global issues.\n","\n","Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress by Steven Pinker\n","\n","Pinker's book presents a compelling case for the notion that the world is becoming a better place. By examining a range of data and statistics, he argues that human progress is a tangible reality. We are living longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives, and this trend is evident across the globe. However, Pinker's optimism is not without its limitations. He dismisses certain evidence that contradicts his argument, and his assertion that economic inequality is not a significant concern for human well-being may be seen as insensitive to the experiences of those living in poverty.\n","\n","Pinker's primary concern is the erosion of Enlightenment values, which he believes are essential for progress. He argues that the increasing popularity of tribalism, fatalism, and distrust poses a significant threat to democracy and global cooperation.

By examining the data, he demonstrates that life is, in fact, getting better. Income, food availability, and lifespan are increasing, while disease, violence, and child mortality are declining. These trends are not limited to developed countries; Africa and Asia are also experiencing significant improvements in living standards.\n","\n","Ridley's explanation for this phenomenon lies in the exchange of ideas and specialisation, which he argues are the driving forces behind human progress. By examining the entirety of human history, from the Stone Age to the 21st century, Ridley presents a compelling case for the notion that human culture evolves in a positive direction.

In certain instances, I concur that prison may not be the most efficacious solution, and community service would likely yield more benefits. \n","\n","One justification for the existence of prisons is to safeguard society by removing perpetrators from the public sphere. Consequently, the primary consideration is whether an individual who has transgressed the law poses a threat to others. In cases of violent crime, there is a compelling argument to isolate the perpetrator from society to prevent harm. Conversely, crimes such as burglary or drug possession do not involve violence against others, thereby rendering the individual a non-direct threat to the community. Imprisoning these types of offenders incurs significant expenses for taxpayers and appears to be an ineffective form of punishment, as they frequently reoffend upon release.\n","\n","Personally, I also believe that punishments should serve a rehabilitative function, aiming to prevent recidivism. Another reason not to imprison these individuals is that they may interact with more violent and dangerous offenders, potentially committing a more heinous crime upon release. By keeping them within the community, engaging in community service, they not only acquire new skills but also develop greater empathy and compassion towards others. Consequently, society benefits from this approach.\n","\n","Detractors of the rehabilitative approach to crime argue that justice should be stringent to deter individuals from committing similar crimes, and that community service may be less effective in achieving this goal. However, there is limited evidence to suggest that lengthy prison sentences serve as an effective deterrent.\n","\n","In conclusion, imprisoning offenders who pose no threat to society is both costly and, in my opinion, ineffective as a deterrent and a form of rehabilitation. Community service for non-violent crimes benefits both society and the offender. Nonetheless, it would be advantageous to have more empirical data to determine whether community service or prison is more likely to prevent recidivism. I firmly believe that decisions regarding the best course of action for dealing with offenders should be grounded in evidence of what actually works.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  10 score:  14.89496793978255\n","A Low-Cost, High-Impact Invention: The Gravity Light\n","\n","Patrick Hunt, a British designer, has developed an innovative, low-cost light that harnesses the power of gravity to generate electricity.

The new regulations will introduce tests that mimic real driving conditions, rather than the ideal, laboratory-like settings currently used. This change aims to enforce a limit of 80mg of nitrogen oxide per kilometre, a threshold met by only one car out of 16, according to researchers.\n","\n","The European Commission Vice President, Frans Timmermans, has given the green light to the tests, which are being closely watched by other countries, including China and Korea, that are also considering similar measures. Diesel engine pollutants, such as nitrogen oxide, carbon monoxide, and particulates, are thought to be responsible for at least a quarter of the 29,000 annual pollution-related deaths in the UK alone.\n","\n","The current 'New European Drive Cycle' laboratory test, which has been in use for a quarter of a century, has been rendered obsolete by technological advancements in the car industry. Studies have shown that car manufacturers can easily manipulate the results of lab tests by using techniques such as taping up doors and windows to minimize air resistance, driving on unrealistically smooth roads, and testing at improbably high temperatures.\n","\n","Moreover, campaigners have accused car manufacturers of using tricks such as programming vehicles to enter a low emissions mode when their front wheels are spinning and their back wheels are stationary, as happens in lab experiments. The European Commission is finalizing a proposal to introduce a new emissions testing procedure that will allow for a proper assessment of vehicles in real driving conditions.\n","\n","According to research by the International Council on Clean Transportation, actual nitrogen oxide emissions from cars are seven times higher than the 80mg/km standard, with some models running at 22 times above the recommended limit. Only one car out of 16 met the 80g target. The car industry has tried to delay reforms to car test cycles, but industry groups deny this, arguing that a five-year lead-time is necessary for technical and economic reasons.\n","\n","The new regulation will force significant emission control hardware changes that may be demanded in the middle of a vehicle's production lifetime. However, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) has accepted that Real Driving Emissions (RDE) will apply to new types of cars from September 2017. The car association sent Timmermans a draft regulation of their own, which would have covered fewer pollutants and further delayed the regulation's phased introduction until 2020.\n","\n","After Timmerman's apparent rejection of the ACEA proposal, the regulation will now pass to commissioners for a rubber stamp and member states for final amendments, before an expected introduction in September. By 2017, the first real-world car emissions tests are expected to begin in earnest, marking a significant step forward in tackling urban air pollution.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  10 score:  13.2893169504644\n","The Cinco de Mayo, or Fifth of May, is a festive holiday commemorated by Mexican communities in the United States.

Notably, 63 percent of these Latinos are of Mexican descent. The Cinco de Mayo celebration is particularly significant in the southwestern region of the United States. It commemorates the Mexican triumph in the Battle of Puebla against French forces on May 5, 1862. Interestingly, the day is observed more enthusiastically in the United States than it is in Mexico itself.\n","\n","In Los Angeles, the city's Cinco de Mayo festivities are renowned worldwide, particularly the Fiesta Broadway, which is the largest celebration of its kind. Over half a million people converge on downtown L.A. to participate in the street fair that spans 24 square blocks. The event takes place on the last Sunday of April and features an array of attractions, including rides, games, and an extensive food selection. This celebration has been growing in popularity year after year.

The authors reveal that most people's responses to these questions are grossly inaccurate, and that our perceptions of the world are distorted by several innate human biases. These biases include a tendency to categorise the world into 'us' and 'them', a predilection for believing that things are getting worse, and a susceptibility to sensationalised media that exploit our fears.\n","\n","According to the authors, the world is not as bleak as we often suppose. While there are certainly genuine concerns, they argue that we should adopt a fact-based mindset, one that is grounded in empirical evidence rather than emotional or ideological convictions. Factfulness is not concerned with the underlying causes of poverty or progress, nor does it offer solutions to these problems. Rather, it seeks to illuminate the instinctive biases that shape our perceptions of the world, and to provide practical advice on how to cultivate a more nuanced and balanced view of reality.\n","\n","Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress, by Steven Pinker\n","\n","In Enlightenment Now, Steven Pinker presents a comprehensive and data-driven account of human progress, challenging the widespread perception that things are getting worse. Pinker argues that we are living longer, healthier, freer, and happier lives, and that this progress is not limited to any particular region or culture. He contends that we should be more discerning in our consumption of news and media, and that we should be wary of sensationalised headlines and apocalyptic narratives that exploit our fears.\n","\n","Pinker's book is a richly illustrated account of human progress, featuring 75 graphs and charts that demonstrate the steady improvement in safety, peace, knowledge, and health across the globe. While Pinker acknowledges that economic inequality remains a significant challenge, he argues that it is not as critical a factor in human well-being as is often supposed. He also warns that the Enlightenment values of reason, science, and humanism are under threat from tribalism, fatalism, and anti-intellectualism, and that this poses a grave danger to democracy and global cooperation.\n","\n","The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves, by Matt Ridley\n","\n","For over two centuries, pessimists have dominated the public debate, proclaiming that things are getting worse. But, as Matt Ridley demonstrates in The Rational Optimist, this is a grossly inaccurate assessment. Ridley presents a compelling case for the proposition that life is getting better, and that this improvement is not limited to any particular region or culture. He shows how human culture evolves in a positive direction, driven by the exchange of ideas and specialisation, and how the internet, mobile phones, and global trade have transformed the lives of millions of people.\n","\n","Ridley's book is a sweeping narrative that spans the entirety of human history, from the Stone Age to the 21st century. He challenges the conventional wisdom that history is a tale of decline and fall, and instead presents a vision of a world that is constantly evolving and improving. The Rational Optimist is a bold and provocative book that offers a compelling alternative to the prevailing pessimism of our times.\n","\n","The Great Surge: The Ascent of the Developing World, by Steven Radelet\n","\n","The Great Surge presents a profoundly optimistic account of the developing world, challenging the widespread perception that these countries are mired in poverty, dictatorship, and despair. Radelet reveals that, over the past 20 years, more than 700 million people have increased their income and escaped poverty, while six million fewer children die every year from disease, millions more girls are in school, and millions of people have access to clean water.\n","\n","This transformation is not limited to any particular region or culture, but is a global phenomenon that is driven by a combination of factors, including the end of the Cold War, the development of new technologies, and brave new leadership.

This swift shift in market dynamics is a testament to the agility of hedge funds, which are adept at identifying emerging trends.\n","\n","The recent surge in oil prices, with Brent benchmark jumping 59% since early November, is largely attributed to the news of successful vaccines and the subsequent relaxation of travel curbs and lockdowns. As a result, global oil demand has begun to recover, with Brent prices nearing pre-pandemic levels of around $60 per barrel. The U.S. crude price has also climbed 54% to approximately $57 per barrel during the same period.\n","\n","Industry experts, such as David D.

Tawil is investing in long independent oil and gas producers, citing the potential for a robust rebound in oil demand as the vaccine becomes widely available and summer travel resumes.\n","\n","However, the International Energy Agency's warning of a potential spike in new coronavirus cases and a slow economic recovery has cast a shadow over the oil market's prospects. Normally, oil producers would increase production as prices rise, but a shift towards renewable energy and caution from lenders has left them struggling to respond.\n","\n","The pace of output recovery in the United States, the world's largest oil producer, is expected to be slow, with production forecast to reach its 2019 record of 12.25 million barrels per day by 2023.

In recent years, the park has undergone significant destruction resulting from the construction of a standard gauge railway line and a highway known as the Southern bypass. These developments pose substantial environmental concerns, given the potential for an enormous combined environmental cost. This study aimed to determine the willingness to pay (WTP) for the restoration of the park's attributes through the implementation of a discrete choice experiment. The focus was on the attributes of (1) wildlife population and species diversity, (2) wildlife movement in dispersion and migration areas, (3) vegetation density and diversity, (4) security of wildlife and human populations, and (5) environmental safety and quality. The data employed in this study were collected from 93 students at the Nairobi campus of Kisii University. A price attribute in the form of an increase in gate fees was incorporated to elicit WTP estimates. Multinomial logit regression estimates indicated that respondents were willing to pay for the restoration of all the attributes except for attribute 4. Attributes 1 and 2 elicited the highest WTP and are likely to be the most affected by the two projects. Middle-aged respondents with stable employment were likely to pay more for the restoration of the attributes compared to students and the youth. Based on the findings, the government could consider relocating the park to a location with superior environmental attributes.\n","\n","Nairobi National Park's ecosystem provides numerous use benefits (direct and indirect) and non-use benefits, including existence, option, and bequest values. The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) defines an ecosystem as a complex and dynamic environment where living organisms (plants, animals, and microorganisms) and non-living organisms interact and function as a unit. An ecosystem provides services to human beings that the World Resources Institute (2005) defines as benefits. The park is Kenya's oldest, dating back to 1946, and measures approximately 117 km². It is situated approximately 7 km south of Nairobi's central business district (GoK, 2012). Kenya is the only country in the world with a national park situated within its capital city. According to the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS), the park is home to over 100 mammalian species, including the endangered black rhino, four of the big five wildlife (lion, buffalo, leopard, and rhino), and over 400 species of migratory and endemic bird species. The park also provides sites for wildlife and bird viewing, picnics, campsites, and walking trails. The park currently charges a gate fee of Ksh 430 to citizens and Ksh 4300 to foreigners.

The multifaceted nature of crimes punishable by prison necessitates a tailored response, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. In certain instances, incarceration may not be the most efficacious solution, and community service may prove a more beneficial alternative. \n","\n","One of the primary justifications for the existence of prisons is to safeguard society by isolating those who pose a threat to public safety.  However, this rationale is predicated on the assumption that all criminals present a danger to others.  This is not always the case, as individuals convicted of non-violent crimes, such as burglary or drug possession, do not necessarily pose a direct threat to the community.  Furthermore, the expense of incarceration for these individuals is a significant burden on taxpayers, and the efficacy of imprisonment as a deterrent is questionable, as many offenders continue to reoffend upon release.\n","\n","In addition to the economic and deterrent-related concerns, I also believe that punishments should be designed to reform individuals, thereby reducing the likelihood of recidivism.  When non-violent offenders are incarcerated, they may be exposed to more hardened and violent criminals, which could potentially lead to an escalation of their criminal activities upon release.  Conversely, community service allows individuals to contribute to society while acquiring new skills and developing a greater sense of empathy and compassion for others.  This, in turn, can only serve to benefit society as a whole.\n","\n","Critics of a more rehabilitative approach to crime argue that justice should be harsh in order to deter potential offenders, and that community service may be insufficient to achieve this goal.  However, there is limited evidence to suggest that lengthy prison sentences are an effective deterrent. \n","\n","In conclusion, imprisoning individuals who do not pose a threat to society is not only expensive, but also ineffective as a deterrent and as a means of rehabilitation.  Community service for non-violent crimes can benefit both society and the offender.  Ultimately, decisions regarding how to deal with criminals should be based on empirical evidence of what actually works.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  11 score:  15.428903797771657\n","Here is the text adapted for C2 class:\n","\n","The invention of a cheap, gravity-powered light by British designer Patrick Hunt has the potential to revolutionise the way people in Africa and India access lighting.

However, he was able to raise £36,200 on the crowdfunding platform Indiegogo within five days, and £400,000 within 40 days. This success was largely due to the platform's ability to allow users to offer \"perks\" for different levels of donation, which not only helped to fund the project but also provided a sense of ownership and engagement for the donors.\n","\n","The gravity light is a perfect example of how meritocratic crowdfunding can be used to test an entrepreneur's idea and prove its worth to potential customers and investors.

As the retail landscape becomes increasingly crowded, with numerous brands competing for attention during the festive season, John Lewis's commitment to emotional storytelling and charitable giving continues to set it apart from its competitors.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  11 score:  11.208472222222223\n","The Canadian tennis player Frank Dancevic slammed Australian Open organizers for forcing players to compete in \"inhumane\" conditions after he collapsed on court as temperatures rose to 41C. Dancevic, who collapsed during the second set of his first-round match against France's Benoît Paire on the uncovered court six at Melbourne Park and passed out for a minute, said conditions were plainly dangerous for the players. He also said the heat had caused him to hallucinate: \"I was dizzy from the middle of the first set and then I saw Snoopy and I thought, 'Wow, Snoopy – that's weird.'\"\n","\n","Dancevic stated that the heat had been so intense that it had caused him to hallucinate and experience heat stroke. He claimed that the conditions were inhumane and unfair to the players, the fans, and the sport. He expressed his concern that the tournament organizers were not taking adequate measures to protect the players from the heat. \"I think it's inhumane. I don't think it's fair to anybody – to the players, to the fans, to the sport – when you see players pulling out of matches, passing out,\" he added.\n","\n","Other players shared Dancevic's concerns. The British number one, Andy Murray, stated that the conditions were \"definitely something that you have to look at a little bit.\" He expressed his concern that the heat could lead to serious health problems, not just for the players but also for the spectators. \"It looks terrible for the whole sport when people are collapsing, ball kids are collapsing, people in the stands are collapsing. That's not great,\" he said.\n","\n","Caroline Wozniacki described the conditions as \"warm,\" while John Isner compared the heat to an oven. The defending champion Victoria Azarenka also expressed her discomfort, stating that it felt like dancing in a frying pan. The tournament's \"extreme heat\" contingency plan was put into force for women's matches on Tuesday, allowing an extra ten-minute break between the second and third sets.\n","\n","However, the tournament director, Wayne McKewen, stated that the conditions were not severe enough to warrant stopping the matches. He explained that the tournament uses the Wet Bulb Globe Temperature composite to assess the heat, which takes into account humidity and wind. According to McKewen, the conditions peaked at 42.2C in the early evening on Tuesday, but they had never reached the point where play would be stopped.\n","\n","Dancevic, who resumed his match after medical attention but ultimately lost, expressed his concern that the tournament organizers were not taking adequate measures to protect the players from the heat. He stated that he had felt dizzy from the middle of the second set and that his body temperature was too high. A ball boy had earlier required medical attention after collapsing during a match, and the tournament shortened rotations for the ball boys to 45-minute shifts.\n","\n","China's Peng Shuai also experienced heat-related illness, cramping up and vomiting during her match. Officials played down health risks, stating that the majority of matches were completed without calls for medical attention. However, most competitors agreed that the conditions were tough, but they were the same for both players, and that it was a mental thing.\n","\n","Dancevic disagreed, stating that it was hazardous to be out there and that some players were more susceptible to the heat than others due to their genetic makeup. He also expressed his concern that the tournament organizers were not taking adequate measures to protect the players from the heat.\n","--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","experimento:  11 score:  12.540353508656008\n","In recent times, it has become increasingly challenging for even the most seasoned defense attorneys to keep track of the numerous allegations levelled against Bill Cosby. The embattled comedian's legal team has filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit filed by plaintiff Judith Huth, who accuses Cosby of sexually assaulting her in 1974 at the Playboy Mansion when she was just 15 years old. \n","\n","According to Huth, she and a 16-year-old friend met Cosby at a film shoot in the Los Angeles area. A week later, Cosby allegedly plied them with drinks at a tennis club, after which the lawsuit claims that he took her to the Playboy Mansion, where he allegedly forced her to perform a sex act on him. Cosby and his attorneys are not taking this lying down, and have filed a demurrer, which challenges the legal sufficiency of the claims or the complaint itself. In essence, the demurrer argues that the complaint is so defective that it should be dismissed. Furthermore, Cosby's attorneys have gone on the offensive, asking the court to impose sanctions against the attorneys who filed this lawsuit.\n","\n","In the court of public opinion, many have already concluded that there is substance to these mounting accusations. However, the jury of public sentiment may be swayed by Camille Cosby's retort that media coverage of her husband is comparable to the Rolling Stone UVA alleged gang rape article. Verdicts in the court of public opinion are notoriously mercurial and rarely restrained by the same strictures applied by the actual judiciary.\n","\n","In real court, however, the rules are decidedly different. Huth's attorneys should have complied with these rules, which include adhering to the statute of limitations. Statutes of limitations are laws that set the maximum period during which one can wait before filing a lawsuit, and they vary depending on the state and type of case. By definition, they deny access to a substantive claim for a purely procedural reason.\n","\n","While limitations periods are arbitrary, the public policy is not: defendants deserve protection of the law too. It makes sense that you should not have to be hauled into court tomorrow for a fender bender you got into with your 1977 AMC Gremlin... in 1977. However, there is a significant difference between a minor traffic accident and sexual assault cases. Limitations periods are more contentious in sexual assault cases because complainants – sometimes children – will repress memories, or fear coming forward. Indeed, the abject terror or trauma caused by an assailant may be why the victim lets the limitations period run.\n","\n","Accordingly, some jurisdictions have special rules extending the time to file in cases of childhood sexual abuse. Under California law, the only way that an alleged victim of childhood sexual abuse is able to bring an otherwise time-barred claim is to allege that the psychological injury was repressed and was only discovered within the last three years. Since this constitutes a potentially limitless limitations period, the rule has two major safeguards built into it to avoid meritless claims and protect the rights of would-be defendants.\n","\n","First, when asserting claims based on alleged childhood sexual abuse, a plaintiff over the age of 26 has to file Certificates of Merit, documents executed by a licensed mental health practitioner attesting that the allegations have merit. Cosby's attorneys correctly point out that Huth failed to file the requisite certificates, which exposes the complaint itself to attack. The public policy behind this rule is sound: taking a plaintiff's word that they repressed a memory that caused them to miss the statute of limitations invites uncertainty and fraud.\n","\n","Huth was 15 years old in 1974 when the alleged abuse took place, and at least 55 years old when she filed this lawsuit. However, Cosby's lawyers point out that she attempted to sell this story to the tabloids more than nine years ago. Even if Huth is allowed to file these certificates, what medical professional will certify her lost memory until three years ago of an event... that she tried to profit from by selling word of it some years before that?\n","\n","Second, the rule provides some protection to would-be defendants and their privacy. After all, requiring some initial scientific proof of a repressed memory and injury is a good idea, but a medical provider cannot really provide any assurances about the identity of an assailant – other than relying upon the patient's words. That's why a plaintiff is prohibited under the rules from identifying the defendant by name until the court gives permission. Huth could have complied with this rule by naming Cosby as John Doe, or some anonymous designation. She did not. Her attorneys filed her Complaint naming Cosby.\n","\n","You might think this is just a clerical gaffe that could be remedied, as many are, by filing an amended complaint. Cosby's attorneys point out that this is no mere mistake that can be fixed. Plaintiff already identified Cosby in the complaint prior to obtaining court permission. Even if Huth amended her complaint, Cosby's name is out there. As Jennifer Lawrence, Kate Upton, and many at Sony have learned, you cannot un-ring the privacy bell – once your name (or image) is out there, it's out there.\n","\n","Childhood sexual abuse is a detestable crime, and the injuries last a lifetime. Recognizing this, modern jurisdictions have amended the normally inflexible statutes of limitations to allow victims their day in court, while seeking to protect would-be defendants from meritless claims. Huth's case illustrates that these rules are not merely procedural. Violating these protective rules threatens the public perception of other legitimate victims who want their day in court.\n","\n","The court of public opinion will likely ignore these violations as technicalities, and continue to judge, and condemn Cosby. That's how that court operates – unfettered by the nuisances of the rules of procedure or evidence. But, under the rules of the Superior Court of California, this complaint should be dismissed.\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["flesch_df = pd.DataFrame({'flesch': flesch, 'true_labels': true_labels})"],"metadata":{"id":"BhiuiOCuZ67b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Plots"],"metadata":{"id":"tRlYj46qqI7E"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Hacer Plot filtrado"],"metadata":{"id":"pUqBykM7Vrfn"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["label_mapping = {0: 'A1', 1: 'A2', 2: 'B1', 3: 'B2', 4: 'C1', 5: 'C2'}\n","\n","values_adapted_filtered = []\n","for i in range(len(flesch_adapted_filtered)):\n","  labels_list = [label_mapping[i % 6]] * len(flesch_adapted_filtered[i])\n","  values_adapted_filtered.append(labels_list)"],"metadata":{"id":"DqZzlUCWaQ1L"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#FILTRADO\n","\n","lista_de_dataframe_filtered = []\n","for i in range (cantidad_experimentos):\n","  lista_de_valores = []\n","  lista_de_labels = []\n","  for j in range (6 * i, 6*(i+1)):\n","    lista_de_valores = lista_de_valores + flesch_adapted_filtered[j]\n","    lista_de_labels = lista_de_labels + values_adapted_filtered[j]\n","\n","  dataframe = pd.DataFrame({'flesch': lista_de_valores, 'true_labels': lista_de_labels})\n","  lista_de_dataframe_filtered.append(dataframe)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"UygrN9oVjOpP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733450732906,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"JUAN CRUZ OVIEDO FERREYRA","userId":"04532813389617512917"}},"outputId":"6ee5c417-c012-4acd-e5e4-821463e5675f"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["experiment:  0 averege:  1.36698442807693\n","experiment:  1 averege:  2.2474232438050223\n","experiment:  2 averege:  5.871724776544803\n","experiment:  3 averege:  11.43682406621778\n","experiment:  4 averege:  14.740137870320737\n","experiment:  5 averege:  16.164549872673614\n","experiment:  6 averege:  1.5079599110484683\n","experiment:  7 averege:  2.5463023154654447\n","experiment:  8 averege:  5.63445436929612\n","experiment:  9 averege:  10.669263970996145\n","experiment:  10 averege:  14.167268898204568\n","experiment:  11 averege:  15.361853481682022\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["for i in range (cantidad_experimentos):\n","  dataframe = lista_de_dataframe_filtered[i]\n","  # Plotting\n","  plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5))\n","  sns.violinplot(data=flesch_df, x='true_labels', y='flesch', palette='viridis', order=order)\n","\n","  # Customize plot\n","  plt.title('Flesch-Kincaid', fontsize=16)\n","  plt.xlabel('')\n","  plt.ylabel('FKGL')\n","\n","  path =file_path + f'/fkgl_adaptado_filtrado_{i}.png'  # Change path as needed\n","  plt.savefig(path, dpi=600)\n","  print(f\"Plot saved to {path}\")\n","\n","  plt.show()"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"TdBhWeBijnXT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1733450736287,"user_tz":180,"elapsed":3382,"user":{"displayName":"JUAN CRUZ OVIEDO FERREYRA","userId":"04532813389617512917"}},"outputId":"c7dc7b14-98af-4269-a766-38a9080d1d16"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["     flesch true_labels\n","0  0.000000          A1\n","1  2.321848          A1\n","2  2.890922          A1\n","3  1.126190          A1\n","4  0.000000          A1\n"]},{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["<ipython-input-54-bad8aa4e6a90>:6: FutureWarning: \n","\n","Passing `palette` without assigning `hue` is deprecated and will be removed in v0.14.0.
